As part of our ongoing automation efforts, we require a dedicated server to host GitHub pipelines within the Dev Citrix environment. This server will be used to run CI/CD workflows, enabling more efficient testing, integration, and deployment processes. The current infrastructure lacks the isolation and performance needed for these operations, and a new host server will ensure stability, scalability, and alignment with our DevOps best practices.
